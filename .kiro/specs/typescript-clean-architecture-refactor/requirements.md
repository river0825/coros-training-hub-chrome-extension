# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing COROS Activity Calendar Chrome extension from JavaScript to TypeScript, implementing clean architecture and domain-driven design principles while following BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), SOLID principles, and TIDY First methodology. The refactor aims to improve code maintainability, testability, and scalability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the COROS Activity Calendar extension, I want the codebase to be written in TypeScript, so that I can benefit from static type checking and improved IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN all source files SHALL be TypeScript (.ts) files with proper type definitions
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN the system SHALL produce error-free JavaScript output
3. WHEN developers work with the code THEN they SHALL have full IntelliSense support and compile-time error detection
4. WHEN external APIs are called THEN the system SHALL use properly typed interfaces for all API responses
5. WHEN Chrome extension APIs are used THEN the system SHALL use official Chrome extension type definitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow clean architecture principles, so that business logic is separated from external concerns and the code is more testable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have distinct layers for domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation
2. WHEN domain logic is implemented THEN it SHALL NOT depend on external frameworks or Chrome APIs directly
3. WHEN application services are created THEN they SHALL orchestrate domain objects and coordinate with infrastructure
4. WHEN infrastructure components are built THEN they SHALL implement domain interfaces and handle external dependencies
5. WHEN presentation layer is implemented THEN it SHALL only handle UI concerns and delegate business logic to application services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to implement domain-driven design, so that the code reflects the business domain and is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain models are created THEN they SHALL represent core business concepts like Activity, Calendar, Statistics, and SportType
2. WHEN domain services are implemented THEN they SHALL encapsulate business rules and domain logic
3. WHEN repositories are created THEN they SHALL provide domain-focused interfaces for data access
4. WHEN value objects are used THEN they SHALL represent immutable domain concepts like Date, Duration, and Distance
5. WHEN aggregates are defined THEN they SHALL maintain consistency boundaries and encapsulate related entities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow SOLID principles, so that each component has a single responsibility and the system is extensible and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are created THEN each SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle)
2. WHEN extending functionality THEN existing code SHALL be open for extension but closed for modification (Open/Closed Principle)
3. WHEN implementing interfaces THEN derived classes SHALL be substitutable for their base types (Liskov Substitution Principle)
4. WHEN defining interfaces THEN they SHALL be focused and clients SHALL NOT depend on methods they don't use (Interface Segregation Principle)
5. WHEN managing dependencies THEN high-level modules SHALL NOT depend on low-level modules, both SHALL depend on abstractions (Dependency Inversion Principle)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to support behavior-driven development, so that requirements are clearly expressed as executable specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow Given-When-Then format describing behavior scenarios
2. WHEN test suites are organized THEN they SHALL group related behaviors and use descriptive naming
3. WHEN domain logic is tested THEN tests SHALL focus on business behavior rather than implementation details
4. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end scenarios from user perspective
5. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL include both unit and integration test scenarios

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to follow TIDY First methodology, so that the codebase is incrementally improved without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring begins THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact throughout the process
2. WHEN code is restructured THEN changes SHALL be made in small, incremental steps
3. WHEN tests are added THEN they SHALL be written before refactoring existing code
4. WHEN new architecture is implemented THEN it SHALL coexist with legacy code during transition
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all legacy code SHALL be replaced with clean architecture implementation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the COROS Activity Calendar extension, I want all existing features to work exactly as before, so that the refactoring doesn't impact my user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN it SHALL display the calendar view with all activities as before
2. WHEN navigating between months THEN the calendar SHALL update correctly with cached and fresh data
3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN all sport type summaries SHALL be calculated and displayed accurately
4. WHEN the extension caches data THEN it SHALL follow the same caching strategy (current month fresh, past months cached)
5. WHEN users interact with the UI THEN all existing functionality SHALL work without any behavioral changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently make changes and ensure the system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are implemented THEN they SHALL cover all domain logic and business rules
2. WHEN integration tests are created THEN they SHALL verify Chrome extension API interactions
3. WHEN end-to-end tests are written THEN they SHALL validate complete user workflows
4. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage
5. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute quickly and provide clear feedback on failures

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection and inversion of control, so that components are loosely coupled and easily testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use a dependency injection container
2. WHEN services are created THEN they SHALL receive dependencies through constructor injection
3. WHEN testing components THEN dependencies SHALL be easily mockable and replaceable
4. WHEN configuring the application THEN dependency bindings SHALL be centralized and explicit
5. WHEN the extension initializes THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved and injected

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear project structure and build configuration, so that the TypeScript project is easy to build, test, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL have clear separation between source, tests, and build output
2. WHEN TypeScript is configured THEN it SHALL use strict type checking and modern ES features
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL compile TypeScript, run tests, and package the extension
4. WHEN development tools are used THEN they SHALL support TypeScript with proper linting and formatting
5. WHEN the extension is packaged THEN it SHALL produce a working Chrome extension with all assets
